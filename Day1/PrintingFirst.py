Exercise 1:
Printing Practice
Write a program that uses print statements to print the following recipe into the Output console.
The text to print is already there,
you just need to make it into code.
Your code should print all five lines exactly the same as the example output below.
Make sure that you don't change any of these existing text as everything, punctuation and casing all need to match!
